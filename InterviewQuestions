üéØ Linux & Shell Scripting Interview Q&A (1-3 Years Exp | Practical Scenarios)
1. Explain the Difference Between Hard Link and Soft Link.
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Hard Link: Points directly to the file‚Äôs inode. Deleting original file doesn‚Äôt break the hard link.
o	Soft Link (Symlink): Points to the file path. If original is deleted, symlink becomes broken.

2. Scenario: Disk Usage Full on EC2 Instance ‚Äî How Will You Debug?
‚Ä¢	STAR Answer:
o	Situation: EC2 instance reports ‚Äúdisk full‚Äù alert.
o	Task: Free up disk space immediately.
o	Action: Ran df -h to find mounted partition usage. Used du -sh * to identify large directories. Cleaned up old log files in /var/log, removed unnecessary temp files.
o	Result: Freed up 10GB, brought disk usage down to safe threshold.

4. Scenario: A Cron Job Didn‚Äôt Execute ‚Äî How Will You Debug?
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Checked cron syntax correctness using crontab -l.
o	Verified script has executable permission (chmod +x).
o	Inspected /var/log/cron or /var/log/syslog for cron logs.
o	Ensured absolute paths used in script (cron runs in minimal environment).

6. Explain Pipe (|) and Redirect (>) in Linux.
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Pipe (|): Passes output of one command as input to another. Example: ps -ef | grep nginx.
o	Redirect (>): Redirects output to file. Example: ls > filelist.txt.

7. Scenario: Permission Denied Error on Script Execution ‚Äî How Will You Fix?
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Ensure script has execute permission: chmod +x script.sh.
o	Verify current user has ownership/access rights (ls -l).
o	Use sudo if elevated permissions required.

8. Write a Loop to Print Numbers from 1 to 10.
‚Ä¢	Answer:
bash
CopyEdit
for i in {1..10}
do
  echo "Number $i"
done

9. Scenario: Application Logs Need to be Archived Daily ‚Äî How Will You Automate?
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Wrote a shell script to compress log files and move to archive folder.
o	Scheduled script using crontab -e to run at midnight daily.

10. What is the Difference Between ps -ef and top?
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	ps -ef: One-time snapshot of all running processes.
o	top: Real-time dynamic view of system processes & resource usage.

11. Scenario: How Will You Find Which Process is Using Port 8080?
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Ran sudo lsof -i :8080 or netstat -tulnp | grep 8080 to identify process.

‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	grep: Searches for specific pattern in files.
o	awk: Processes and extracts data from structured text (columns/fields).

13. Scenario: Need to Monitor CPU Usage Every 5 Minutes ‚Äî How Will You Script This?
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Wrote a Bash script using top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)" to capture CPU usage.
o	Scheduled it in crontab every 5 mins to log output.
________________________________________
14. What is the Difference Between Relative and Absolute Paths in Linux?
‚Ä¢	Answer:
o	Relative Path: Starts from current directory (e.g., ./script.sh).
o	Absolute Path: Full path from root (e.g., /home/user/script.sh).
________________________________________
15. Scenario: Shell Script Executes in Terminal but Fails in Jenkins ‚Äî How Will You Debug?
‚Ä¢	STAR Answer:
o	Situation: Shell script works fine locally, fails in Jenkins pipeline.
o	Task: Make it Jenkins compatible.
o	Action: Checked environment variables in Jenkins (minimal shell). Updated script to use absolute paths. Ensured Jenkins user has necessary file permissions.
o	Result: Script executed successfully in Jenkins after environment adjustments.
